            <p>We are conducting research of human decision-making in interactions with robots.
                We have developed a <em>bot</em> that will be your opponent in a simple investment game.
                Before playing the game, we will collect some basic demographic information from you and
                you will complete a short questionnaire. We will then explain the game to you and verify
                your understanding with a comprehension check. More information about the experiment is
                available in the <a href="https://trust-game-experiment.herokuapp.com/info.pdf" target="_blank">Information Sheet</a><a ></a>, which
                you must read before participating.
            </p>

            <p>
                It should take you around 10 minutes to complete this task. Your base
                remuneration is $0.2, but if you pass a comprehension check and complete
                the game, you will be paid at least $1.8 in bonus. The size of the bonus
                will depend on your performance in the game, with potential additional
                earnings up to $3.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the unlikely scenario of an application error preventing you from completing
                the game, please take a screenshot and email it to maciej.olejnik@seh.ox.ac.uk along
                with your worker ID, a brief explanation of what happened and any other relevant
                evidence. Your assignment will then be approved.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Responsible Gaming</strong> â€“ placing investments and gaming in general can be
             addictive and may result in difficulties to stop. Do not participate in
             this task if you have any concerns about whether this reward-based
             experiment might adversely affect your behaviour.</p>

            <p><strong>Make sure to leave this window open as you play the game.&nbsp;</strong>
